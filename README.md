# SysUID
System Monitoring tool which gives user information from Server


This script is being created to give a comprehensive amount of information from the limited access we have on the ICS systems.
It is currently being actively created by me and things will be added as upon discovery until we have a strong tool in our kit where we can get necessary client info in one place like his/her details, job info, allocations and usage stats.
